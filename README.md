# Comp-Neuro-Roadmap
Learning Computational Neuroscience

This repository contains my beginniner-level computational neuroscience/ML projects. I'll mainly explore EEG signal processing, motor image classification, and simple BCI simulations. My goal is to learn Python, MNE-Python, and machine learning applied to neural data.

The skills/tools I plan on learning include: Python, Google Colab, MNE-Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, EEG data processing.

Roadmap (10 weeks max)

Project 1: Python and Data Foundations
Project 2: Intro to Neuroscience
Project 3: EEG Preprocessing
Project 4: Machine Learning on EEg
Project 5: Toy BCI Simulation

I'll try my best to be consistent, and learn thoroughly!
